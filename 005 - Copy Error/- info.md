Division yields duplication, here with symmetries across arbitrary axes. Flaws in replication create unforeseen mutations, unrepeatable conditions. Inspired by the work of [Bader and Oxman][1], here we introduce perturbations into a perfect system, we induce a copy error. Every generation intends to be a flawless mirror, but errors create novelty instead. Implemented as point-clouds in [Processing][2] and geometry in [Houdini][3], the exploration generates digital dreamscapes evoking the work of Ryoji Ikeda and alien forms reminiscent of sculptures by Ivana Ba&#353;i&#263;.
